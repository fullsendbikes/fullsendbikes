San Mateo published a video explaining how California law classifies and regulates e‑bikes and other small electric rideables, with a focus on safety and what’s legal on San Mateo streets. <br>

## Summary - Purpose and context

San Mateo Polie Department hosts a “Real Talk” session to clear up confusion around e‑bikes, scooters, mopeds, small electric motorcycles, and motorized boards, especially for parents buying them for kids.  They emphasize this is an evolving area of law and that the main goal is education, *not discouraging ownership.*  <br>

## Core legal definitions

An “electric bicycle” must have pedals and a motor no more than 750 watts; above that, it is no longer an e‑bike under California law. <br>
There are three e‑bike classes: <br>
* Class 1: pedal assist only, up to 20 mph. <br>
* Class 2: throttle (no pedaling needed), but motor cuts out at 20 mph. <br>
* Class 3: pedal assist only, up to 28 mph. <br>
​

If a vehicle exceeds e‑bike power/speed limits but is under 3,000 watts and 30 mph, it is treated as a moped/motorized bicycle; above that (and built for road use) it becomes a motorcycle under the Vehicle Code. <br>
* “Off‑highway motorcycles” (e.g., Sur‑Ron‑type electric dirt bikes) are for off‑road use only and are illegal on any public road or sidewalk statewide. <br>
* Electric scooters are defined as two‑wheeled, floorboard/seat, handlebar-equipped devices powered by an electric motor. <br>
​

Unicycle-type devices have tight size, power (under 1,000 W), and speed (max 20 mph) limits; anything outside those specs is treated as an illegal electric skateboard on public roads. <br>

## Rules, age limits, and equipment

For Class 1 and 2 e‑bikes, no driver’s license is required; helmets are required under age 18, and bikes **must carry a manufacturer label** showing class, top assisted speed, and motor wattage. <br>
For Class 3 e‑bikes, riders must be at least 16, helmets are required for all ages, and a **speedometer** is required. <br>
​Passengers are only allowed where the e‑bike has a permanent seat; peg/handlebar riding is not allowed and all passengers must wear helmets. <br>

Mopeds/motorized bicycles require an M1 or M2 motorcycle license (minimum age 15½), a special plate/registration, DOT helmet(s), and full motorcycle-type equipment (lights, horn, brake light); they are not allowed in bike lanes. <br>
Electric scooters require a driver’s license (again, minimum 15½), but no plate and no mandatory insurance; riders must obey standard vehicle rules and **cannot make left turns** in‑lane — they must dismount and walk across intersections. <br>

Off‑highway electric bikes/dirt bikes (sur run, talaria, etc) on public roads can be cited and impounded, with total costs easily reaching into the thousands. <br>​

## Where you can and cannot ride

Under California law, bicycles and e‑bikes are treated as vehicles, so the usual vehicle rules apply: stopping at stop signs, riding with traffic, and no wrong‑way riding. <br>
In San Mateo specifically, riding on sidewalks is prohibited, and riders may not ride through crosswalks; they must dismount and walk. <br>

## Lane types and e‑bike access:
Class 3 bike route (“sharrow” on the street): Class 1, 2, and 3 e‑bikes allowed; riders may take the lane for visibility. <br>
Standard Class 2 bike lane: Class 1 and 2 allowed. <br>
Class 4 separated bikeway: Class 1 and 2 allowed, not Class 3. <br>
​Class 1 off‑street path or trail: Class 1 and 2 allowed unless a local rule prohibits them. <br>
When no bike lane exists, riders must use the right side of the roadway, with the usual exceptions (passing, left turns, obstructions, one‑way streets). <br>
​

## Safety, enforcement, and resources
The presenters stress the severity of injuries from high‑speed electric vehicles, and the particular risk to young riders who exceed design speeds with easy “mods.” <br>

Parents **can be criminally liable** for giving a vehicle that legally requires a license (moped/motorcycle) to a child who does not have one, or for enabling unlicensed riding. <br>

San Mateo Police Department recommends formal training and information from CHP (motorcycle and e‑bike safety programs, app, DMV handbook) and provide links.
