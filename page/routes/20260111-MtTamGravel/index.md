## Mt Tamalpais Gravel – A Scenic North Bay Loop
Hey folks, here's a fantastic gravel route that showcases Marin County's natural beauty. This nearly 38-mile adventure is perfect for anyone looking to mix their road miles with some quality gravel exploration.

## The Nitty-Gritty
Distance: 37.86 miles
Elevation: Nearly 3,400 feet climbing with virtually matching descent – you'll earn every bit of that elevation back on the way down
Terrain: Gravel cycling through protected lands and open space preserves

## What You'll Experience
The route kicks off from the Mill Valley area and immediately takes you into some seriously scenic terrain. You'll be riding through the Mount Tamalpais Watershed – one of those green zones you see on the map that just screams "this is gonna be beautiful." The elevation profile tells the real story here: you've got a solid climb early on around the 12-mile mark where you'll punch up about 700 feet of elevation, giving you that satisfying "I'm getting a workout" feeling.

## The Highlights:

Muir Woods National Monument area – you're rolling through old-growth redwood country with some genuinely stunning vistas

Stinson Beach (GGNRA) – the western exposure gives you those Bay Area panoramic views

Ring Mountain Open Space Preserve – more protected land with excellent gravel infrastructure

Golden Gate views – seriously, on a clear day the views from certain sections are absolutely worth the effort

The route drops down toward the coast, which is where things get really fun. You get some sweet descending through beautiful landscape before heading back inland. The second half has a more mellow elevation profile with some undulating terrain that keeps things interesting without being brutal.

## Vibe Check
This is classic Marin gravel – well-maintained, scenic, and accessible to riders at various fitness levels, though it's still a solid distance. The mix of open space preserves and coastal approaches makes this feel more like an adventure ride than a structured training session. Perfect for a weekend morning where you want to get some miles in, see gorgeous scenery, and maybe grab coffee in Mill Valley afterward.

Definitely worth adding to your rotation if you're in the Bay Area!
