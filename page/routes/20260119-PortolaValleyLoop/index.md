This Portola Valley Loop is a mellow, scenic 30‑mile road ride with rolling terrain and about 1,500 feet of climbing, perfect for a steady endurance day rather than a sufferfest. You’ll cruise classic Peninsula cycling roads near Portola Valley and Woodside, with views of oak-studded hills, open space preserves, and easy access back toward Stanford and Palo Alto at the ends of the loop.

Along the way, popular chill spots include Roberts Market in both Woodside and Portola Valley for snacks, water, and a quick sit-down, plus nearby cafés if you want coffee or a sandwich. Public restrooms and water are available at Arastradero Preserve’s parking area and in town near the markets, so it’s easy to top off bottles or make a bathroom stop without much detour.
