## Fun for the whole family

This multi-use trail is fantastic for riders, runners, and gravel rides that extend to the south of the posted GPX route.  Parking is available on local sidewalks outside of the Parks and Rec lot, if you're staying after-hours.  The mostly flat coastal path that runs parallel to the ocean, with wide-open views of bluffs, cypress trees, and long sandy beaches. As you head along the trail, you’ll pass a string of Half Moon Bay State Beach access points and overlooks, with plenty of spots to pull over, watch the waves, and enjoy the post-sunset glow. Much of the route is paved and smooth, making it beginner-friendly and perfect for a relaxed evening spin.
