## A Classic Bay Area Road Ride
This Paradise Loop route heads over the Golden Gate area toward Marin, then circles the Tiburon Peninsula with constant bay views and mellow rolling terrain. At around 45 miles with under 2,000 feet of climbing, it’s friendly for a solid tempo day or a relaxed social ride, and you’ll get big sightlines of Angel Island, the San Francisco skyline, and the Marin Headlands along the way. <br>

There are plenty of relaxed places to stop: downtown Tiburon with rider‑friendly spots like Caffè Acri and others near the ferry terminal, markets like Woodlands Market for snacks and drinks. Sausalito offers other easy coffee or breakfast stops, like Cibo and multiple waterfront cafés where you can park bikes in view. You’ll roll by [Blackie’s Pasture](https://www.blackiethehorse.com/) and the Tiburon [Linear Park](https://destinationtiburon.org/itineraries/home-base) path, which have benches and a mellow vibe if you want a low‑key water or snack break. <br>

Public restrooms and water are straightforward on this loop: there are bathrooms and fountains at Blackie’s Pasture/Linear Park where the bike–walking paths start, plus facilities in downtown Tiburon near the ferry terminal and waterfront parks. Sausalito’s waterfront parks and the Mill Valley–Sausalito Path trailhead areas also have restrooms and water, so with a couple of quick mental notes you’re never far from a bathroom or refill. Overall it’s a very low‑stress, scenic ride with lots of bailout, snack, and bathroom options, which makes it easy to just enjoy the miles. <br>
