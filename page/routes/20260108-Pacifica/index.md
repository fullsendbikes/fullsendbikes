An intermediate ride through Pacifica.  Avoids black-diamond features and jump sections.  You'll start on a fire trail ascending toward the summit, adjacent to the popular "Boy Scout" jump area.  A further climb on switchbacks to the summit, with a fun descent on single track down.  Watch for hikers, owls, and glorious views of the ocean.  Another climb toward the park exit, finishing with an easy ride out. <br> Many options easily traversible with E-Bike, acoustic MTB or gravel bike (though may be challenging for the latter).  Offers stunning views of Pedro Point Headlands, and Farralon Islands on a clear day.  Windy, sometimes wet, and unpredictable.
