Local favorite, known for quiet roads, few cars, sweeping views. <br>
80/20 Road and Gravel mix.   <br>
Can be completed with road tires (32mm min recommendation).  More fun with actual gravel configuration.  <br> 
You'll ascend [Montebello Road](https://www.strava.com/segments/627158/local-legend?category=overall&athletes=all_athletes) and climb a bit more to the summit. <br> 
The fast descent down Page Mill Road takes you back to your car.  Bring water, sunscreen as summit offers little shade. <br>
