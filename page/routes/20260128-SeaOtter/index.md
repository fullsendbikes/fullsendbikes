## The Coastal Rollercoaster
The Sea Otter Classic in Monterey, California, is essentially the "Spring Break" of the cycling world. While the expo is all about shiny new gear and crowds, the gravel race—held in the Fort Ord National Monument—is a masterclass in "deceptively difficult."

## The Nitty-Gritty
**Distance:** 29.6 miles per loop (typically 3 laps in the race) <br>
**Elevation:** 2,800 feet climbing with virtually per lap <br>

## What You'll Experience
The scenery is quintessentially Californian: golden rolling hills, ancient oak trees draped in Spanish moss, and (if you’re lucky) views of the Pacific in the distance.

**The Vibe:** It’s high-energy. You aren't just racing in the woods; you are racing in the middle of a massive cycling festival.

**The Terrain:** It isn’t "chunk" in the way East Coast or Midwestern gravel is. It is largely comprised of fire roads, sandy chutes, and hard-packed ranch roads. * The "Sea Otter" Special: Expect the infamous "Moon Dust." If it hasn't rained recently, the corners get filled with fine, silty sand that *can wash out your front tire* if you aren't careful.

## Training
You don't need to be a pro, but you do need "punchy" fitness. This isn't a route where you settle into a steady rhythm for four hours. <br>

**Climbing Resilience:** The elevation gain isn't achieved through one long mountain; it’s death by a thousand cuts. You’ll face short, steep "wall" climbs that require high anaerobic power. <br>

**Handling Skills:** Because of the sand and occasional rutted descents, your core strength and bike handling are just as important as your lungs. <br>

**Endurance Base:** Depending on the distance you choose, you should be comfortable with 3–5 hours in the saddle at a high effort level. <br>

## What to Bring
Usually "layer-heavy." It can be 45°F and foggy at the 8:00 AM start, then 80°F and bone-dry by noon.  Dust is also a challenge, so a buff and larger eyewear are encouraged.  40mm tire with good sidewall knobs will balance speed and stability in the sand.
