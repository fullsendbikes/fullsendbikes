**Suspension Settings: Quick and Easy** <br>

Proper suspension pressure lets the bike use its travel efficiently, keep good traction, and hold a stable, predictable ride height (geometry) so it corners, brakes, and climbs the way the frame was designed to. When sag and pressure are in the right zone, the fork and shock can both compress and extend over bumps, which keeps the tires glued to the ground instead of skipping around and makes the bike feel planted. <br>

If your pressure is high (not enough sag), the bike will feel harsh and chattery, like it’s riding on top of every rock instead of smoothing them out. You’ll notice less grip in corners and under braking, and it can feel nervous and skittish, especially on loose or rough sections. Small bumps will stress hands and feet, and you'll find you aren’t using travel even on rough trails. <br>

If your pressure is low (too much sag), the bike can feel wallowy and vague, like it’s riding “in” the travel all the time rather than floating in the middle. The fork may dive when you brake or hit steeps, making the front end feel steep and twitchy, while the rear can squat in corners and under load so the bike feels sluggish and unpredictable when you push it. You’ll bottom out more often on bigger hits, which can feel like a sharp thunk through the frame and kill confidence when you start riding faster or hitting drops. <br>

Nailed suspension pressure is that sweet spot where the bike feels comfy on chatter, has support when you push into berms or compressions, and quietly uses almost all its travel a few times on a hard run without feeling harsh or mushy. <br>

Also note, suspensions can leak air over time.  [FullSendBikes](https://fullsendbikes.com) checks your suspension during each tune-up. <br>

## Rear Shock Recommended Starting Values ##

Start with a person's (loaded) weight and measure static sag with shock in Open position <br>
* Never exceed recommended settings (typically 300 PSI)
* Adjust PSI until 25-30% of sag is met.  
* Adjust in 10-15 PSI increments, and cycle shock repeatedly until sag is set.

Rockshox setup is similar, but often aim for 30% sag for comfort. <br>
