## After 10,000 miles, here's what happened to this electric bike

While not my article, I found it well-written and fascinating.  I'm not particularly fond of Ride1Up E-Bikes because their base models come with cost-effective hardware and inexpensive human contact points.  As a mechanic, I've encountered bent hangers, chainrings, or broken brake calipers on a 1up.  I would love to see this review coming from a sturdy and well-equipped bike like a Urtopia or Orbea.  <br>
I also appreciate the average 3,000 miles on a "discount" E-Bike. That tracks with my experience.<br>

E-Bike = $.019 per mile, which includes maintenance <br>
