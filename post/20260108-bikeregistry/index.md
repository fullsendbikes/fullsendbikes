Various methods of registering your bicycle are available after purchase.  Check with your local county for options.  [East Bay](https://bikeeastbay.org/register/) counties have a local resource.  However most local police use BikeIndex as a primary reference.  <br>
Some sites provide a tamper-proof sticker as a visible deterrent to would-be thieves. <br>
Finally, if you're purchasing a used bicycle and want to verify its origin, this service is also available. <br>

Be sure to register your bicycle with the manufacturor to receive future notification for warranty, recalls, and other possible service upgrades.  Check there, too.  <br>
